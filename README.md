| --------------- | ----------------- |
| LED PWR is HIGH | LED PWR+ is HIGH,  LED PWR- is LOW |
| LED PWR is LOW | LED PWR+ is LOW,  LED PWR- is LOW |
| LED HDD is HIGH | LED HDD+ is HIGH,  LED HDD- is LOW |
| LED HDD is LOW | LED HDD+ is LOW,  LED HDD- is LOW |
| SW PWR is HIGH | BTN PWR+ and BTN PWR- connected, the power button is pressed |
| SW PWR is LOW | BTN PWR+ and BTN PWR- disconnected, the power button is unpressed |
| SW RST is HIGH | BTN RST+ and BTN RST- connected, the reset button is pressed |
| SW RST is LOW | BTN RST+ and BTN RST- disconnected, the reset button is unpressed |

## 3. B-board

The b-board has an adapted full-height and half-height metal PCI mounting plate, which can be installed on the computer case. The user connects the pins on the B-board to the ATX control interface on the computer motherboard using the color DuPont cables provided with the product.
